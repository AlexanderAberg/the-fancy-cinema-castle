### Thoughts behind our choices

- We wanted to make an inclusive and stigma free site for sexually transmittes infections.
- We used rainbow related colours to show that we are inclusive and that you can be yourself.
- Our direction to LGTBQI+ is because the community is more stigmatized and therefore less likely
to find out about infections in time.
- We want people to be able to get recommendations so they have a next step to take.


### Agile

- We have worked agile to be able to adjust and fix issues that need to be prioritized.
- High level of open communication mainly through slack.
- The scope has changed during the course of the project according to the agile philosophy of it being most important with a good enough functioning product.


### Kanban

- Worked in a Kanban board on GitHub to see where we are with our features in the project.
